This is for turning scenarios

-populate randomly more pedestrian in start -area (avoid overlap, and generate in timer 2 seconds)
-have the longer corridor: longer from beginning -500, after narrowing corridor, we also have longer corridor
-measure longer x- direction up to 250 meters from 0
-longer time, do not stop when all of them escape, only stop at 500 seconds 
-dump to log files as in folder log_velocity: in corresponding c values and index
-only capture velocity-x over-time and velocity-x per x-position
